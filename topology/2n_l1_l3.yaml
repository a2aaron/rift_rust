# Topology: 2n_l1_l3

#  | node1     |
#  | (level 3) |  <<< More than 1 level difference between hard-configured level 3
#  +-----------+      on node1 and hard-configured level 1 on node2.
#        | if1        Furthermore, neither node1 nor node2 is a leaf.
#        |            Hence, the adjacency should stay in 1-way and not come up to 3-way.
#        | if1        But, despite the fact that the adjacency is not allowed to reach 3-way,
#  +-----------+      the offer in the received LIE is still accepted and considered as a
#  | node2     |      Valid Offered Level (VOL) to determine the Highest Available Level (HAL).
#  | (level 1) |      But since the adjacency will not reach 3-way, it will not be considered for
#  +-----------+      Highest Adjacency in Three-way (HAT).
